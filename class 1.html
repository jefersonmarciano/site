                    📌 Why is this AI so powerful?
                    The AI we use is not just any tool. If we tried to develop an AI of this level from scratch, the cost would be billions of dollars. However, since our technology is already based in China, we were able to bring it to the public with a much smaller investment.
                    While the AIs available in the United States are limited to only 20% of quantum processing power, ours operates at 100% capacity, allowing for much greater precision in market forecasts.
